# Spring 2025 UG Research Project on MS ODE Modeling in MATLAB
Angeli Varghese

This semester I was an undergraduate researcher in Dr. Ford-Versypt's Systems Biomedicine and Pharmaceutics Lab at UB. My project focused on replicating Multiple Sclerosis models from the Kannan and Montolio papers.

Kannan paper(A minimized unified model of disease trajectories captures hallmarks of MS): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2017.03.006

Montolio paper(A mathematical model to predict the evolution of retinal nerve fiber layer thinning in multiple sclerosis patients): https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.103357
